               Let's go back to the human being,<br>
AS WE HAVE LOST IT THERE IS SOME WAY.<br>
We evolved into war and warriors;<br>
LET'S FIND THE HUMAN TRAIL.<br>
LET'S BACK TO BEING HUMAN.<br>
That's what we're meant to be.<br>
It's true that we are complex<br>
BUT WE CAN LIVE IN HARMONY.<br>
Back to the human being.<br>
What does this mean to you?<br>
Is it wrapped up in your words or your thoughts<br>
AND ALL THE THINGS YOU DO?<br>
Let's get back to being human.<br>
I REALLY think we should<br>
LIKE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN
flows in Your BLOOD.</p>
